i should convert the video to searchable text and parse it with GENSIM or at least word count: ÂçåÂçåÂçå
-> but counting the words roughly by hand should be sufficient

- the >>>> russians <<<< ÂçåÂçå
idiots on both or all sides, but also good people on both or all sides

- assessin jfk <- psychological warfare

- cia: ÂçåÂçåÂçåÂçåÂçåÂçå

- mkultra Count: ÂçåÂçåÂçåÂçå

- LSD, drogues ÂçåÂçåÂçå

- sleep deprivation... 

- Suicide <- portscanning my DBS for [ good | bad ] ?

- loop recorder

- subProject No #xxxxx => google-selector / event-trigger / HoneyPot?
=> The search for the Manchurian candidate disguised as a leak about Manchurian candidates?

- psychic driving

man is programmed and reprogrammed <- posers, they use always the same concept knowledge design patterns

anyone can be broken <- i doubt, but i know i should learn to take psychological warfare against me more seriously

"reality are in fact very difficult to cope with" <- consciousness or knowledge about this sort of things helps to cope with the situation, eg:

1:59:40: he controls a colony of monkeys

Simple SRC:

1. Stalk all people with technology
2. feed the data in behavioral- / action-recognition algorithms
3. sort them into an ArrayList<TODOs> or better an OrderedList<TODOs>
4. then you need additional accoustic or visual channel (eg. Cell Phone)
(Stimulus Response Habit, clark hull formula)
5. if you need Monkeys / NPC's to annoy people like me with an autistic helmet upvote the TODOs from the zone where i am

WARNIGN: if i do unpredictable moves your mainframe will habe about 10 Minutes until it searched through all the 10'000 - 50'000 Datasets of the NPC's


As a Christian I should follow the ten commandments, BUT as an autistic person as soon as Satan has hacked God's vessel, I would rather burn in hell than not try to get Satan out of there ...


but the [IMAGE] is a nice source ... TNX
